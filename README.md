# Dogs vs Cats Competition by leo

My code for the [Dogs vs Cats Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition). The competition took part in 2014, so now it is only possible to submit results for checking your score! Dataset can be obtained by the link, and I based my code in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4F3HGYXf4).

## First version
- Data preprocessing (numpy array, grayscale): generating training and testing data by functions
- First CNN with 2 layers: 50% accuracy
- Second CNN with 6 layers: 85% accuracy in 15 epochs.
